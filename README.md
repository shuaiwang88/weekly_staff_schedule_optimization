# weekly_staff_schedule_optimization

Backgroud: a dog care(opens 24/7) with 4 locations needs a staff scheduling system. 
The employee are able to work at all 4 location with preference, and they have 
hard constraint on the shifts(ex, students cannot work on day shift, artists
cannot work on night shift)
